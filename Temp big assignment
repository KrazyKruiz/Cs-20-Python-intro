Temp = int(input("What are you measuring the temperature with? Type \"1\" for Celcius, \"2\" for Farenheit, or \"3\" for Kelvin"))
temp1 = int(input("What was the temperature on sunday?"))
temp2 = int(input("What was the temperature on monday?"))

temp7 = int(input("What was the temperature on saturday?"))

DailyTemp = [temp1, temp2, temp3, temp4, temp5, temp6, temp7]

if Temp = 1:
    Celcius = temp1 + temp2 + temp3 + temp4 + temp5 + temp6 + temp7
